    Exploring lamp design.

  <div class="description">
    Divi is a multi-functional object. It serves to help the user connect and express emotion. Divi is both a lamp and a room divider which interacts with the user through its physical being via the touch interface.
    <br><br>
    Divi consists of calculated woodworking along with current technology reacting and adapting to the users' needs and mood.
    To turn Divi on, the user applies a certain amount of pressure to a designated area on the touch screen. There are three color settings; orange, blue and light pink, which are illuminated through hand pressure; orange requires firm pressure, blue is medium, and pink is light. To turn Divi off, you simply double tap the touch sensor.
    <br><br>
    Interacting with Divi takes some time and practice. Soon enough you'll discover how much pressure you need for each specfic color.
    <br><br>
    In Divi’s initial design phase, sustainability and longevity were key factors to consider. The hope was to create an object that was personal, designed to last, with a minimal Eco footprint. These factors remain a challenge when designing meaningful objects.

    MindFull

  <div class="subtitle">
    Design for the community.
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    For MindFull, my group and I had to design and produce an object that would be sold at a fundraiser to raise money for a local cause. We chose the local women's shelter, Chez Doris, located in Montreal’s Shaughnessy Village. For our item, we decided to design an apron because we wanted to bring awareness to people around food scarcity. When families are in between homes, finding food for can be a challenge and we wanted to highlight how most people take for granted how accessibility to food.
    <br><br>
    The design of the apron kept in mind the theme of minimizing waste. The patterning for it used all components of a large square of organic cotton which was locally sourced. We then screen printed a design that read “No Waste. Non Gaspillage.” in bright orange to grab attention. We then sewed the aprons ourselves, which included hemming, creating straps and pockets.
    <br><br>
    Our fundraiser was a huge success and we managed to sell all 10 handmade aprons.

    Build-Up
  </div>
  <div class="subtitle">
    Game design for children.
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    This game was inspired by another designer’s style, Marc Newson. The aim of the game is very simple: stack as many of the irregular blocks as possible without knocking down what is already set on the foundation. Each player can place one block per turn. The game comes with two “foundations”, one flat and one curved. Resembling an organic Jenga, Build-Up has a simple construction with a complex look. Each block was cut, sanded, and then coated with beeswax, making it friendly for even the youngest players.

    Uncoventional book design.
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    “Failures” is a play written by Louis Patrick Leroux. The opportunity was to design an experimental booklet for the play. Given complete freedom in the design of this booklet, I was able to take an approach that played with the layout of the dialogue between characters along with experimenting with the physical form of the pages.

    For this project, I experimented typography and layout. The parameters were the text and the size of the paper, standard 8.5 X 11. I experimented with different typefaces, font-sizes, paragraphs styles, along with margins, or lack thereof.
