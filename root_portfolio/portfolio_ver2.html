    Exploring lamp design.

  <div class="description">
    Divi is a multi-functional object. An object that serves to help the user connect and express themselves emotionally. Divi is both lamp and room divider and interacts with the user through its physical being via touch interface.
    <br><br>
    Divi consists of calculated woodworking along with present day technology to help it be its best self and help the user live their best life.
    To turn Divi on, the user has to apply a certain amount of pressure to a designated area on the touch screen located at the top. Divi has three color settings; orange, blue and a light pink, that are turned on through hard pressure, medium pressure and light pressure, respectively. To turn Divi off, all you have to do is double tap the touch sensor.
    <br><br>
    How you interact with Divi takes some getting used to. But with a little time, you’ll learn a little more about how much pressure you need for whatever color you’d like. In due time, you will know
    <br><br>
    In Divi’s initial design phase, sustainability and longevity were key factors to remember. To create and object that was personal, built to last, and had a minimal Eco footprint was a challenge. But through planning and prototyping, this was achieved.

    MindFull

  <div class="subtitle">
    Design for the community.
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    For MindFull, my group and I had to design and produce an object that in the end would be sold at a fundraiser to raise money for a local cause. We chose the local women's shelter, Chez Doris, located in Montreal’s Shaughnessy Village. For our item, we decided to design an apron because we wanted to bring awareness to people surrounding food. When you are in between homes, finding food for you and even your family can be a challenge and we wanted to highlight how most people take for granted how accessible food it to most of us.
    <br><br>
    The design of the apron kept in mind the theme of minimal waste. The patterning for it used all components of a large square of organic cotton that was locally sourced. We then screen printed a design that read “No Waste. Non Gaspillage.” in bright orange to grab people’s attention. We then sewed the aprons ourselves, which included hemming, creating straps and pockets.
    <br><br>
    Our fundraiser was a huge success and we managed to sell all 10 handmade aprons.

    Build-Up

  <div class="subtitle">
    Game design for children.
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    This game was inspired by another designer’s style, Marc Newson. The aim of the game is very simple: stack as many of the irregular blocks as you can without knocking down what is already set on the foundation. Each player can place one block per turn. The game game with two “foundations”, one flat and one curved, closely resembling one of the building pieces but much larger. Resembling an organic Jenga, Build-Up has a simple construction with a complex look. Each block was cut, sanded, and then coated with beeswax, making it friendly for even the youngest players.

    Uncoventional book design.

  <div class="description">
    “Failures” is a play written by Louis Patrick Leroux that I had the opportunity to design the experimental booklet for. Given complete freedom in the design of this booklet, I was able to take an approach that played with the layout of the dialogue between characters along with the pages themselves.

  <div class="description">
    For this project, I was given the opportunity to play with experimental typography and layout. The only parameters were the texts we could use along with the final size of paper the project be printed on, being standard 8.5 X 11.  I was able to experiment with different typefaces, font-sizes, paragraphs styles, along with margins, or lack thereof.
